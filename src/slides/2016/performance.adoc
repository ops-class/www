== Today

* Performance and benchmarking.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* Questions about the collaboration policy?
* [.spelling_exception]#ASST3.3# is due Friday May 6th @ 5PM
* The final exam is two weeks from today: Monday, May 9 @ 3:30PM.
* Recitations resume this week covering
** ASST3 swapping (this week)
** Exam review (next week)

== Operating System Performance

[.slider]
.Why do we care?
* Understandable but interesting fact: people prefer a *mostly-correct*
but *extremely fast* system to a completely correct and slow system.
* *Thought experiment*: would crashes bother you _at all_ if your system
rebooted *instantaneously*?

== THE Last Correct Operating System

[quote, Edsger Dijkstra]
____
We have found it is possible to design a refined multiprogramming system
in such a way that its logical soundness can be proved a priori and that
its implementation admits exhaustive testing. The only errors that
showed up during testing were trivial coding errors (occurring with a
density of only one error per 500 instructions), each of them located
with 10 minutes (classical) inspection at the machine and each of them
correspondingly easy to remedy.

== Operating System Performance

OK, so we care about performance... [.slide]#but operating system performance
is *not so different* from improving the performance of any other computer
system or program.#

[.sliders.spelling_exception]
.Here's what to do:
. *Measure* your system.
. *Analyze* the results.
. *Improve* the slow parts.
. *Drink* celebratory beer.
. *Goto* 1.

== But Seriously...

[.slider]
.What's so hard here?
. *Measure* your system. [.slide]#*How* And doing *what*?#
. *Analyze* the results. [.slide]#You mean *statistics*? Ugh.#
. *Improve* the slow parts. [.slide]#*How* And *which* slow parts?#
. *Drink* celebratory beer. [.slide]#*Which* beer? And *where*? (But I'm ready for one after the
statistics.)#

== Measuring Your System: How?

Should be *easy* to measure time passed on a single computer, right?

[.slider]
.Welcome to the *wonderful* world of hardware:
* High-level software counters may not have fine enough resolution to
measure extremely fast events.
* Low-level hardware counters may have extremely device-specific
interfaces, making cross-platform measurement more difficult.
* All counters *roll* eventually, and the higher-resolution the faster.

<<<

Measurements should be *repeatable*, right?

[.slider]
.*Wrong!*
* You are trying to measure the present, but the rest of the system is trying
to [.slide]*use the past to predict the future*.
* In general _real_ systems are almost *never* in the exact same state
that they were the last time you measured whatever you are trying to measure.

== Measuring Real Systems

Yet another problem: measurement tends to affect *the thing you are trying to
measure*!

[.slider]
.This has three results:
. Measurement may *destroy* the problem you are trying to measure.
. Must separate *results* from the noise produced by measurement.
. Measurement overhead may *limit* your access to real systems.
* Vendor: "_No way_ am I running your instrumented binary. Your software
is slow enough already!"

== (Aside) Measuring Operating Systems

You can imagine that this is *even more* fraught given how central the
operating system is to the operation of the computer itself.

[.slider]
* Difficult to find the appropriate places to insert debugging hooks.
* Operating systems can generate *a lot* of debugging output: imagine
tracing _every_ page fault. (And imagine how slow that system would be!)

== Let's Measure Something Else...

OK, benchmarking *real* systems seem *real* hard.

[.slider]
.What else can we do?
* Build a *model*: abstract away all of the low-level details and
reason analytically.
* Build a *simulator*: write some additional code to perform a
simplified simulation of more complex parts of the system—particularly
hardware.

[.slider]
.Distinguishing *models* from *simulations* is pretty easy:
* "I see equations." *That's a model.*
* "I see code." *That's a simulation.*

== Choosing the Right Virtual Reality

[.slider]
.Models:
* *Pro*: can make *strong* mathematical guarantees about system
performance...
* *Con*: ...usually after making a bunch of *unrealistic* assumptions.

[.slider]
.Simulations:
* *Pro*: in the best case, experimental speedup outweighs lack of
hardware details...
* *Con*: ...and in the worst case bugs in the simulator lead you in all
sorts of wrong directions.

== Measuring Your System: What?

[.slider]
.What metric do I use to compare:
* Two *disk drives*?
* Two *scheduling algorithms*?
* Two *page replacement algorithms*?
* Two *file systems*?

== Benchmarks: Definitions

[.slider]
.**Micro**benchmarks:
* try to isolate *one* aspect of system performance.

[.slider]
.**Macro**benchmarks:
** measure one operation involving many parts of the system working
together.

[.slider]
.*Application* benchmarks:
** focus on the performance of the system as observed by one
application.

[.small]
== Benchmarks: Examples

Let's say we are interested in improving our *virtual memory* system.
(Just a random choice.)

[.slider]
.**Micro**benchmarks:
* Time to handle single *page fault*. (Micro enough?)
* Time to *look up* page in the page table?
* Time to *choose* a page to evict?

[.slider]
.**Macro**benchmarks:
* Aggregate time to handle page faults on a heavily-loaded system?
* Page fault rate?

[.slider]
.*Application* benchmarks:
* *`triplesort`*?
* *`parallelvm`*?

== Benchmarks: Problems

[.slider]
.**Micro**benchmarks:
* Tree, meet forest. *May not* be studying the right thing!

[.slider]
.**Macro**benchmarks:
* Forest, meet trees. Introduces *many, many* variables that can
complicate analysis.

[.slider]
.*Application* benchmarks:
* Who cares about your stupid application? Improvements for it *may
harm* others!

== Benchmark Bias

Bigger problem with benchmarking in practice.

[.slider]
* People *choosing and running* the benchmarks may be trying to
justify some change by *making their system look faster*.
* Alternatively, the people *chose* a benchmark and did a lot of work to
improve its performance while ignoring other effects on the system.

== Benchmarking Blues

This isn't (all) just human folly. There's a *fundamental* tension here.

[.slider]
* The *most useful* system is a general-purpose system.
* The *fastest* system is a single-purpose system.

== What TO Do

[.slider]
. Have a *goal* in mind more specific than "I want to make this blob of
code faster." This helps choose measurement techniques and benchmarks.
. *Validate* your models and simulator *before* you start changing
things.
** Do their results match your intuition? If not, something is wrong.
** Do their results match reality? If not, something is _really_ wrong.
. Use modeling, simulation, and real experiments as appropriate.
** If you can't convince yourself analytically that a new approach is an
improvement, don't bother simulating.
** If your simulator doesn't show improvement, don't bother
implementing.
