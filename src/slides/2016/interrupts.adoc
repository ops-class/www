* Our link://github.com/ops-class/test161[new OS/161 testing tool] should be
released soon.
* We will have video lectures next Monday and Wednesday since I will be away.
** I will add the appropriate lectures to the course
link://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6LEE8y2Jp-kbEcVR2W3vfx0Pdca0BD3[YouTube playlist].
** You can come here and watch during class time or on you own time.

== ``wait()``/``exit()``

[.slider]
* We often consider `wait()` and `exit()` together, since they combine to
remove any trace of a process from the system.
* Until a process _both_ calls `exit()` and has its exit code collected
via `wait()` traces of it remain on the system:
** Its return code is retained by the kernel.
** Its process ID (or PID) is also retained. Why?
* Processes that have ``exit()``ed but not had their exit code collected are
called *zombies*. (Ooh, scary!)

== ``wait()``/``exit()``

[.slider]
* ``wait()``/``exit()`` also present an interesting synchronization problem you
will solve for ASST2.
** Calls to ``wait()`` (by the parent) and ``exit()`` (by the child) may
interleave in the kernel.
** You must guarantee that the parent can retrieve the exit code
successfully.

== ``wait()``/``exit()`` Issues

[.slider]
* What happens if a process's parent exits before it does?
** The "orphaned" process is assigned the `init` process as a parent,
which will collect its exit code when it exits. Referred to as
[.spelling_exception]#reparenting#.
* How do we prevent zombies from taking over the machine?
** A processes parent receives the SIGCHLD signal when a child calls
`exit()`, alerting it to the chance to retrieve the child's exit status.
** On some systems a process can choose to have its children
automatically reaped by ignoring this signal.
** On bash the relevant command is the appropriately-named disown. This
allows children to continue running as daemons even after bash exits.

== What If I Don't Want to `wait()`?

[.slider]
* Parent may want to peek at the exit status of its child, just to check
on it. (Are you dead yet? Are you dead yet?)
* Systems support a non-blocking `wait()` for this purpose:
** *Blocking `wait()`* will block until the child exits, unless it has
already exited in which case it returns immediately.
** *Non-Blocking `wait()`* will not block. Instead, its return status
indicates if the child has exited and, if so, what the exit code was.

== Our Simple Shell

[.slider]
* Disclaimer: this is C-like pseudo-code. It will not compile or run!
(But it's not far off.)

.Where's `exit()`?

== Aside: `errno`

[.slider]
* There is potential confusion between kernel system calls and wrappers
implemented by `libc`:
** `_exit()` (system call) v. `exit()` (C library function call).
* The C library wraps system calls and changes their return codes.
* The C library is what sets `errno`, not the kernel.

[.nooutline]
== Questions About Processes?

== [.small]#Multiplexing and Abstracting the CPU#

For the next several weeks we'll be looking at how the operating
system manages the processor:
[.slider]
* What are the *limitations or problems* with the hardware resource
that the operating system is trying to address? _There is only one (or
at least, no that many) processor(s)!_
* What are the *mechanisms* necessary to allow the processor to be
shared? _Interrupts and context switching._
* [line-through]#What are the *consequences* for programmers of processor
multiplexing? _Concurrency and synchronization._#
* How do we design good *policies* ensuring that processor sharing
meets the needs of the user? _Processor scheduling._

== Today: Operating System Privilege

[.slider]
* Earlier we alluded to the fact that the operating system is _like_ a
normal program with some special privileges.
* In fact, implementing most of the process-related system calls we
discussed last week *does not require these special privileges!*
** If you don't believe me, look at user-space threading libraries. They
provide functionality very similar to the `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()` and
`wait()` system calls we discussed.
* So *why does the operating system need special privileges?*

== Multiplexing Requires Privilege

[.slider]
* In many cases implementing abstractions does not require special
privileges.
* However, the operating systems other task—multiplexing
resources—*does.*

== Multiplexing Requires Privilege

[.slider]
* In order to divide resources between processes the system needs a
trusted and privileged entity that can:
** *divide* the resources, and
** *enforce* the division.

== [.spelling_exception]#No Trusto Processo#

[.slider]
* Why can't processes share resources without a privileged arbiter?
* Some processes are:
** malicious—"Hey, I'd like some more memory, so I'll use yours!"
** buggy—"Um, is this my memory or your memory? I'm not sure but I'll
just use it and hope things turn out OK..."

== Privileged Execution

[.slider]
* CPUs implement a mechanism allowing the operating system to manage
resources: *kernel* (or privileged) *mode.*
* Being in kernel mode may mean that the executing code
** has access to *special instructions*, and
** has a different *view of memory*.

== Special Instructions

[.slider]
* When the CPU is in *kernel mode* there are special instructions that
can be executed.
** These instructions usually modify important global state controlling
how resources are shared.
* When the CPU is not in kernel mode it does not allow these
instructions to be executed.
** We will see what happens when an unprivileged process tries to
execute a privileged instruction in a minute.

== Protection Boundaries

[.slider]
* The goal:
** *only trusted kernel code* runs in kernel mode;
** untrusted user code *always runs in user mode*.
* The CPU implements mechanisms to transition between user and kernel
mode which we will discuss during the rest of today's class.

== Aside: Fine-Grained Protection

[.slider]
* Many modern CPUs implement *more than two* protection modes.
* x86 processors actually have four protection "rings" from Ring 0 (most
privileged) to Ring 3 (least privileged).
* For many years operating systems running on x86 architectures only
used Ring 0 (kernel mode) and Ring 3 (user mode).
* Recently this has become more interesting because of operating system
virtualization, so we will return to this.
** But for now, you can think of processors as having two privilege
modes: kernel mode and user mode.

== Terminology

[.slider]
* When we say _"application"_ we refer to code running without
privileges or in unprivileged or "user" mode.
* When we say _"kernel"_ we mean code running in privileged or kernel
mode.
* What makes the kernel special? *It is the one application allowed to
executed code in kernel mode!*

== Bootstrapping Privilege

[.slider]
.Why is the operating system allowed to run in kernel mode?
* *You installed your machine that way!* This is what it means to
install an operating system: choose a particular application to grant
special privileges to.

[.slider]
* On boot the CPU starts out executing the kernel code in privileged
mode, which is how *privilege is bootstrapped*.
* The kernel is responsible for lowering the privilege level before
executing user code.

== More Terminology: Traps

[.slider]
* When a normal application does something that causes the system to
enter *kernel mode* we sometimes refer to this as _trapping_ into the
kernel.
* I frequently think about the thread that trapped into the kernel as
*running in the kernel* after the trap occurs.
** On some level this is accurate: it is the same stream of
instructions.
** On some level this is not accurate: the kernel thread has its own
stack and has saved the state of the trapping user thread, so in a way
the user thread has been paused while the kernel performs some task on
its behalf.
* *Decide the way to think about this that is the most effective for
you.*

== Privilege Transitions

[.slider]
* The transition into the kernel or into privileged mode typically
occurs for one of three reasons:
** a hardware device requests attention—*hardware interrupt*
** software requests attention—*software interrupt* or system call
** software needs attention—*software exception*
* What is the difference between _requesting_ and _needing_ attention?

== Hardware Interrupts

[.slider]
* Hardware interrupts are used to signal that a particular device needs
attention:
** a disk read completed, or
** a network packet was received, or
** a timer fired.
* Processors implement multiple *interrupt lines*, input wires on which a
logic transition (or level) will trigger an interrupt.

== Interrupt Handling

[.slider]
.When an interrupt is triggered (interrupt request, or IRQ), the processor:
.  *enters privileged mode*,
. *records state* necessary to process the interrupt,
. *jumps to a pre-determined memory location* and begins executing
instructions.

[.slide]
--
The instructions that the processor executes when an interrupt fires
are called the *interrupt service routine* (ISR).
