== Today

* Simple schedulers.
* Slightly more complex schedulers.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

* Two weeks to complete ASST2.
* Screen casts are up, and `test161` targets and a new `test161` release
should be out Monday.
* *Please contact the course staff if you are working alone.* We have some
important information for you.
* Any questions about submitting using `test161`?

== Review: Scheduling: What?

[.slider]
.What is scheduling?
* *Scheduling* is the process of choosing the next thread (or threads)
to run on the CPU (or CPUs).

[.nooutline]
== Review: Scheduling: Why?

[.slider]
.Why schedule threads?
* *CPU multiplexing*: we have more threads that cores to run them on.
* *Kernel privilege*: we are in charge of allocating the CPU and must
try to make good decisions. *Applications rely on it.*

[.nooutline]
== Review: Scheduling: When?

[.slider]
.When does scheduling happen?
. When a thread *voluntarily* gives up the CPU by calling yield().
. When a thread makes a blocking *system call* and must sleep until
the call completes.
. When a thread *exits*.
. When the *kernel decides* that a thread has run for long enough--and uses a
timer interrupt to take control.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Human-Computer Interaction (and Expectations)

[.slider]
. What do you expect from your machine?
* *Respond* (Click)
* *Continue* (Watch, or active waiting)
* *Finish* (Expect, or passive waiting)

[.nooutline]
== Review: Scheduling Goals

[.slider]
* How well does it meet deadlines—unpredictable or predictable?
* How completely does it allocate system resources?
** No point having idle CPU, memory, or disk bandwidth when something
useful could be happening.
* On human-facing systems, deadlines (or *interactivity*) usually wins. Why?
[.slider]
** Your time is more valuable than your computer's.
* *Performance*: making great scheduling decisions is futile if the
decision process itself takes _forever_.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Conflicting Goals

[.slider]
* Scheduling is a balance between *meeting deadlines* and *optimizing
resource allocation*.
* Responsiveness and continuity require meeting deadlines—unpredictable
or predictable.

[.nooutline]
== Why Schedule: Questions?

== Scheduling Information

Today we will talk about schedulers that use *three* kinds of
additional information in order to choose what thread to run next:

[.slider]
* *What will happen next?* Oracular schedulers can _cannot be
implemented_ but can be a good point of comparison.
* *What just happened?* Typical schedulers—and many other operating
system algorithms—_use the past to predict the future_.
* *What does the user want?* Schedulers usually have ways to
incorporate user input.

== Random Scheduling

[.slider]
* Choose a *scheduling quantum*. This is the maximum amount of time any
thread will be able to run at one time.
* Then:
[.slider]
.  Choose a thread a random from the *ready pile*.
.  Run the thread until it it blocks or the scheduling quantum expires.


[.slider]
.What happens when a thread leaves the waiting state?
* Just return it to the ready pile!

== Round-Robin Scheduling

[.slider]
* Choose a *scheduling quantum*. This is the maximum amount of time any
thread will be able to run at one time.
* Establish an ordered ready queue. For example, when a thread is
created add it to the tail of the ready queue.
* Then:
. Choose the thread at the head of the ready queue.
. Run the thread until it it blocks or the scheduling quantum expires.
. If its scheduling quantum expires, place it at the tail of the ready
queue.
* What happens when a thread leaves the waiting state?
** Could put it at the head of the ready queue, or at the tail.

== The Know Nothings

[.slider]
* The *random* and *round robin* scheduling algorithms:
** require no information about a threads past, present, or future, and
** accept no user input.
* These are rarely useful algorithms except as straw men to compare
other approaches to.
* Both *penalize*—or at least do not reward—threads that give up the CPU
before their quantums expire.
* As one exception, *round robin* scheduling is sometimes used once
other scheduling decisions have been made and a set of threads are
considered equivalent.
** As an example, you might rotate round-robin though a set of threads
with the same priority.

== The Know-It-Alls

Let's say we can predict the future. What might we like to know about
the thread we are about to execute?

[.slider]
* *How long* is it going to use the CPU!
* Will it *block* or *yield*?
* How long will it wait?

== Shortest-Job First

[.slider]
.Why would we use this algorithm?
* *Minimizes waiting time!*

[.slider]
.More generally, why would we prefer threads that give up the CPU before their time quantum ends?
* They are probably waiting for *something else*, which can be done in parallel with CPU use.

== Monday: The Story of the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler

* How one Australian anaesthetist changed the Linux kernel forever...
and then gave up.
* The scheduler may be fair, but is Linux development?
* A fascinating view into the Linux community, and a good story
highlighting many aspects of large-scale community-driven operating
systems development.
* Including discussion of the BFS (Brain F*ck Scheduler).
