== Today

* OS virtualization and containers

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.3`] Checkpoint

.At this point:
//
* If you have not started, you're *way, way* behind.
//
* Get started!

*link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.3`] is due Friday 5/5. Good luck finishing!*

[.nooutline]
== Congrats on Finishing ASST3

== Review: Hardware Virtualization

[.slider]
//
.How did we create a virtual machine (VM)?
//
* Start with a physical machine
//
* Create software (hypervisor) responsible for isolating the guest OS inside
the VM
//
* VM resources (memory, disk, networking, etc.) are provided by the
physical machine but visibility outside of the VM is limited

<<<

[.slider]
//
.What were the implications?
//
* VM and physical machine _share same instruction set_, so must the
host and guest
//
* Guest OS can provide a _different application binary interface_ (ABI) inside
the VM
//
* Lots of challenges in getting this to work because guest OS expects to have
privileged hardware access

== Operating System Virtualization

[.slider]
//
.How do we create a virtual operating system (container)?
//
* Start with a [.slide]#real operating system#
//
* Create software responsible for isolating [.slide]#guest software# inside
the container
//
** (That software seems to lack a canonical name--and today it's actually a
bunch of different tools.)
//
* Container resources [.slide]#(processes, files, network
sockets, etc.)# are provided by the real operating system but visibility
outside the container is limited

<<<

[.slider]
//
.What are the implications?
//
* Container and real OS [.slide]_share same kernel_
//
* So applications inside and outside the kernel must [.slide]_share the same
ABI_
//
* Challenges is getting this to work are due to [.slide]_shared OS namespaces_

== Containers v. VMs

[.slider]
//
.You can run Windows inside a container provided by Linux.
//
* *False.* Container shares the kernel with the host.

[.slider]
.You can run SUSE Linux inside an Ubuntu container.
//
* *True.* All long as both distributions use the same kernel, differences are
confined to different binary tools and file locations.

[.slider]
//
.Running `ps` inside the container will show all processes.
//
* *False.* Container process namespaces is isolated from the host.

== Hypervisor v. Container Virtualization

image:http://crishantha.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lxc.png[width="80%"]

== Why Virtualize an OS?

Shares many (but not all) of the benefits of hardware virtualization with much
lower overhead.

[.slider]
//
.Decoupling
//
. [line-through]#Cannot run multiple operating systems on the same machine.#
//
. Can transfer software setups to another machine as long as it has
a identical or nearly identical [line-through]#hardware# kernel.
//
. Can adjust [line-through]#hardware# container resources to system needs.

<<<

[.slider]
//
.Isolation
//
. Container should not leak information inside and outside the container
//
. Can isolate all of the configuration and software packages a particular
application needs to run

== OS v. Hardware Overhead

[.slider]
//
.Hardware virtualization system call path:
//
* Application inside the VM makes a system call
//
* Trap to the host OS (or hypervisor)
//
* Hand trap back to the guest OS

[.slider]
//
.OS virtualization system call path:
//
* Application inside the container makes a system call
//
* Trap to the OS

<<<

[.slider]
//
* Remember all of the work we had to do to deprivilege the guest OS and deal
with _uncooperative_ machine architectures like x86?
//
* OS virtualization *does not require any of this*: there is only one OS!

== OS Virtualization is About Names

[.slider]
//
.What kind of names must the container virtualize?
//
* *Process IDs*
** `top` inside the container shows only processes running inside container
** `top` outside the container may show processes inside the container, but
with different process IDs
//
* *File names*
** Processes inside the container may have a limited or different view of the
mounted file system
** File names may resolve to different names--and some file names outside the
container may be removed

<<<

[.slider]
//
* *User names*:
** Containers may have different users with different roles
** `root` inside the container should not be root outside the container
//
* *Host name and IP address*
** Processes inside the container may use a different host name and IP address
when performing network operations

== OS Virtualization is About Control

The OS may want to ensure that the entire container--or _everything_ that
runs inside it--cannot consume more than a certain amount of:

[.slider]
//
* *CPU time*
//
* *memory*
//
* *disk or network* bandwidth

== Not a New Idea

Forms of OS virtualization go back to `chroot` from 1982:

[source,bash]
----
chroot - run command or interactive shell with special root directory
----

[.slider]
//
.How is this done?
//
* Instead of starting path resolution at inode #2, start somewhere else.

<<<

Modern container management systems like https://www.docker.com[Docker]
combine and build upon multiple lower-levels tools and services.

== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces[Linux namespaces]

Since 2002 Linux has provided namespace separation for a variety of resources
that typically had unified namespaces

[.slider]
//
* *Mount points*: allows different namespaces to see different views of the
file system
//
* *Process IDs*: new processes are allocated IDs in their current namespace
and all parent namespaces
//
* *Network*: namespaces can have private IP addresses and their own routing
tables, and can communicate with other namespaces through virtual interfaces
//
* *Devices*: devices can be present or hidden in different namespaces

== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups[`cgroups`]

____
...a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource
usage of a collection of processes.
____

[.slider]
//
* Processes and their children remain in the same `cgroup`
//
* `cgroups` may it possible to control the resources allocated to a set of
processes

== http://unionfs.filesystems.org/[UnionFS]

A stackable unification file system.

[.slider]
//
.Path name resolution:
//
* Does `/foo/bar` exist in the top layer? If yes, return its contents.
//
* Does `/foo/bar` exist in the next layer? If yes, return its contents.
//
* Etc.

<<<

[.slider]
//
.Can also hide parts of the lower file systems:
//
* Does `/foo/bar` exist in the top layer? If yes, return its contents.
//
* Access to `/foo` in the next layer is prohibited, so stop. (Even if
`/foo/bar` exists.

== COW File System

Previous container libraries made a copy of the parent's entire file system.
(Containers need a lot of it.)

[.slider]
//
.What could we do instead?
//
* Copy on write!
//
* Only make modifications to the underlying file system when the container
modifies files.
//
* Speeds start up and reduces storage usage.
//
** The container mainly needs read-only access to host files.

== What is Docker?

.Docker builds on previous technologies
//
* Provides a unified set of tools for container management on a variety of
systems
//
* Layered file system images for easy updates
//
* Now involved in development of containerization libraries on Linux
