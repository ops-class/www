[.meme-bottom]
I took the red pill

[.nooutline]
== Why I'm Here

[.slider]
* I took CS161 @ Harvard--now also known as CSE 421/521 at the
University at Buffalo--from Margo Seltzer in 2001
* At that point I was a physics major, but I wouldn't be for long&hellip;
* ...because I discovered that I loved building computer systems and teaching
people about them.
* I would up in graduate school (where I TA'd this course many times).
* And graduate school landed me right back here to begin the cycle again.

== Introducing the 2017 Course Staff

We probably have the *best* course staff ever this year: a mixture of new
TAs, veteran volunteers, and a large group of "ninjas"&mdash;students returning
from last year to help out.

.Official Teaching Assistants
[.slider]
. *Ali Ben Ali* (returning from last year)
. *Carl Nuessle* (returning from forever)
. *Vicky Zheng* (took the class last year)

[.slide]
--
We're still working out roles, but you'll probably see all three TAs in
recitation and office hours.
//
They will also work together to mark all human-graded work.

== Operating Systems Briefly Defined

.Operating System:
[.slider]
. A *computer program* that
. *multiplexes hardware resources* and
. *implements useful abstractions*.

[.slide]
--
The OS is just another computer program! [.slide]#(If a large,
complex, mature and mission critical one.)#
--

[.slide]
--
*Multiplexing* allows multiple people or programs to use the same set of
hardware resources--processors, memory, disks, network connection--safely and
efficiently.
--

[.slide]
--
*Abstractions*--processes, threads, address spaces, files, and
sockets--simplify the usage of hardware resources by organizing information
or implementing new capabilities.
--

== Motivating This Class

[.slider]
* How many of you have participated in OS development?
* How many of you regularly program in languages that use operating system
abstractions directly?
* And C is a dead language--rightfully so!
* So why study operating systems? Why is this class even offered? *Why is it
required?*

== !

[.meme-top]
Remind me

[.meme-bottom]
What's this for again?

== Why Study Operating Systems?

[.slider]
* *Reality*: this is how computers really work, and as a computer scientist or
engineer you should know how computers really work.
* *Ubiquity*: operating systems are everywhere and you are likely to eventually
encounter them or their limitations.
* *Beauty*: operating systems are examples of mature solutions to difficult
design and engineering problems. Studying them will improve your ability to
design and implement abstractions.

== Why Program Operating Systems?

[.slider]
* *Design*: programming operating systems stresses the importance of careful
design and specification before coding begins. You will learn the value of
design, probably the hard way.
* *Difficulty*: operating systems are large existing code bases where new
solutions have stringent performance requirements. Programming operating
systems will make you a better programmer and improve all of your subsequent
work.
* *Debugging*: debugging operating systems is challenging due to their multi-
threaded nature and the lack of typical debugging support provided to
applications. Again, debugging operating systems will sharpen your debugging
skills.

== Course Structure

[.slider]
* Conceptual learning...
[.slider]
** Lectures
** Recitations
** Exams
* ...by doing (programming).

== Learning Objectives: Conceptual

.When you finish CSE 421/521 you will:
[.slider]
. understand the abstractions supported by modern operating systems
. be able to describe how operating systems policies and mechanisms safely
and efficiently multiplex hardware resources
. be able to analyze historical, current, and emerging operating system
designs and features

[.slide]
--
The main way we will know that you are learning is by your participation in
class and recitations.
--
[.slide]
--
You will be tested for mastery on exams.
--

== Conceptual Progression

[.small.slider]
* Introduction to operating system abstractions and structure.
* Abstracting and multiplexing:
[.slider]
** the CPU--interrupts, context, threads, processes, processor scheduling,
thread synchronization.
** memory--memory layout, address translation, paging and segmentation,
address spaces, translation caching, page fault handling, page eviction,
** swapping.
** storage--spinning disks and Flash, spinning disk scheduling, on-disk
layout, files, buffer cache, crash and recovery.
* Virtualization.
* Networking (time permitting)

== Learning the Concepts

[.slider]
* Attend class.
* Come to class on time:
** Music starts as soon as I can get into the room...
** Lectures will start at 2:05PM sharp and finish by 2:50PM.
* Ask questions during class.
** I'm very flexible about how much we cover this semester.
** I would rather teach less and have everyone understand it.
** Our back-and-forth during class is the one of the few indicators I have of
how much you are absorbing...

== OS/161

* OS/161 is an instructional operating system developed by David Holland at
Harvard University.
//
* It attempts to strike a balance between Linux and other extremely-mature
systems--too difficult to hack on--and existing instructional operating
systems frameworks--not realistic enough.
//
* Your OS/161 kernel runs in an emulator, `sys161`, which emulates an MIPS
r2000/r3000 instruction set architecture (ISA).
//
* Using `sys161` allows us to simplify debugging and hardware support.

== 10,000 Hours

[.slider]
//
* While many operating systems concepts are elegantly simple, implementing
them is not.
//
* Therefor, this class is not easy:
//
** [red]#2.87# on "Appropriate Workload" score in the
//
link:/courses/buffalo/CSE421_Spring2016_Evaluations.pdf[2016 course evaluations]
//
(93%+ response rate).
//
* However, this class is also worthwhile:
//
** [green]#3.97# overall rating (2016).

== 2016 Positive Student Feedback

[.smaller.spelling_exception]
//
--
//
* I liked the lectures/videos/notes, the course website and assignment
submission/feedback system is stellar, and Geoff is very enthusiastic about
the course.
//
* The OS161 project and the amount of of hours provided for it was
incredibly challenging but manageable. The heavy weight on exams allowed good
leniency so the project wasn't one make or break grade.
//
* The projects were really good. I learnt a lot from them. TAs were really
helpful.
//
* The work is very hard, but incredibly engaging. This course is definitely a
real-world prep course and goes beyond the classroom, teaching time
management, problem solving and different types of thinking. The lectures were
very interesting and the course website is fantastic!
//
* Geoff is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. You can tell he is
passionate about what he teaches
//
* Everything... The professor goes out of his way let everyone learn what he
wants to teach.
//
* The efforts put forth by professor and TAs is really good. They have
designed the course structure and timeline very well. Also, one thing which I
felt in love with was `test161`. It is the test suite I have never seen
before. They have worked very hard for that
//

[.nooutline]
== 2016 Negative Student Feedback

Of course, not everyone is happy.

[.smaller.spelling_exception]
//
--
//
* There are 2 sides to Geoff either he is in a great mood or he is in a bad
mood. I think that he is generally a really nice guy but you do not what to
get on his bad side.
//
* He made students feel very unwelcome during office hours, he seemed hostile
and rude at times to students who were struggling but nice to others who had a
better understanding. I was personally scared of interacting with him due to
the way he treated students during office hours.
//
* Professor Challen is a sadistic being.
//
* Failed at being a developer at Microsoft and in turn came back to haunt the
halls of the CSE department.
//
* Still keeps sending emails to all CSE students more than any other
in the department. Better to stop doing that.

== Continuous Choose-Your-Own Grade Programming Evaluations

[.slider]
* All assignment grading in CSE421/521 is automated.
* Therefore... you can have your code graded repeatedly whenever you like.
* Therefore... you can stop each assignment whenever you are satisfied with
your grade.

== Continuous Choose-Your-Own Grade Details and Caveats

[.slider]
//
* Assignments are done in pairs, so find a partner who is interested in
achieving the same grade as you are.
//
* Note that we do not allow students to work alone except in extremely
unusual circumstances.
//
** "I want to work alone" does not represent one of these situations!
//
* Assignments are cumulative and we will not distribute solution sets without
a significant penalty.
//
* Late submissions will also be penalized.

== Communication

* We will sign you all up for a mass email list.
//
* We also have a Discourse forum linked off the website which is the best way
to get help quickly.

== Using Email

[.slider]
* If you need to email the course staff (#staff@ops-class.org#), please consider
the following:
[.slider]
** Is this information likely to be available on the website? If yes, go find it!
** Is the answer to this question likely to benefit other students? If yes,
use Discourse.

[.slider]
* Before you email me directly, please also consider the following:
[.slider]
** Is this something that the course staff could answer? If yes, email them.
* Here's the bottom line: the more time we spend answering repetitive email,
the less time we have available to help you with real problems.

== Getting Help: Recitations

* Recitations this year will cover a mix of conceptual and assignment-driven
material.
//
* There are also screen casts on the website for each assignment. We may
update them as we go along.

== Getting Help: Office Hours

[.small]
--
[.slider]
* All TAs and Ninjas will be holding office hours.
** We are hoping to have around 40 hours of office hours scheduled per week,
meaning that you have plenty of opportunities to complete the challenging
CSE 421 assignments.
* Office hours are the best place to get help on the programming assignments.
* CSE 421/521 office hours will be in Davis Hall in locations announced on the
calendar, but probably near Davis 301B or in the Second Floor atrium.
* Just come in and do the assignments during office hours--that way, when you
get stuck, you are in the right place.
--

== Getting Help: Working in Pairs

Partner groups are jointly responsible for joint work.

[.slider]
* If any part is plagiarized, both partners fail.
* If any part is plagiarized, both partners fail.
* If you have concerns about work your partner has submitted, immediately
approach the course staff.
* If you do not we will assume later that your consent was given.
* It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that your team's submission
is fair and reflects your contributions.

[.slide]
--
Pair programming assignments for CSE 421/521 are very clear about what kinds
of collaboration are permitted. We consider violating these expectations to
be cheating.
--

== Getting Help: Helping Each Other

[.slider]
* The course staff will be working as hard as you--and sometimes harder--but
there are many of you and few of us. Look to your left and your right: these
are your comrades.
* Good classes come through CSE 421/521 as a team.

== Collaboration

* Simple rule: talking about code is collaborating, talking in code (or
exchanging code) is cheating.
** Unless you are talking to your partner in which case anything goes.

== Cheaters

* I take cheating very seriously:
[.slider]
** Not because I am vindictive and mean...
** ... but because I believe in protecting and honoring those of you that
work hard and play by the rules.

[.meme-top]
I will find cheaters

[.meme-bottom]
No matter how long it takes

== Cheaters

* We will use an online service to detect and investigating code similarity.
[.slider]
** It is very fast, so we can use it on every submission.
** It is very accurate.
** We will compare your assignment against everything we can think of: this
years', last years', anything you can find online, assignments submitted at
Harvard, etc.
** I have a _huge_ repository of old assignments now. If you can find it, I've
already got it.

== Keep Your Code Private

[.slider]
//
* You will need a private Git repository that you and your partner can use.
//
* Lots of options here:
//
** GitHub has limited private repos for students.
//
** GitLab and other Git providers also provide private repositories.
//
* It does need to support deployment keys so that we can clone your repository
during testing.

== Cheaters

* We catch and fail cheaters. Not for the assignment: for the entire class.

== Next Steps

. Start link:/asst/setup/[setting up your environment] and
link:/asst/0/[ASST0]
//
. Find a partner!
//
. Wednesday we will go through ASST0 together in class
//
** *Please* at least get your `vagrant` environment set up before coming to
class, since it requires a large download. More on the forum soon.
//
. We will schedule one-time office hours on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
for those struggling to get started.
//
. Recitations and regular office hours will start next week.
