== Today

* Review address translation.
* Page translation and the TLB.

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/2/[`ASST2`] Checkpoint

.At this point:
//
* If you are not done with all of the system calls, *you're behind.*
//
* If you're handling errors and minor problems, you're OK.

[.nooutline]
== PS: ASST2 and ASST3 Are Hard

[.slider]
* Hopefully you've realized this by now.

Turns out ASST2

[.meme-bottom]
Is all of Vol 1

== Please Don't Cheat

[.slider]
* When that last-minute freak out hits you...
* *Don't cheat.*
* We'll catch you and you'll fail the class.

[.nooutline]
== Efficient Translation

*Goal*: [.slide]#almost _every_ virtual address translation should be able to
proceed without kernel assistance.#

[.slider]
.*Why?*
* The kernel is *too slow*!

[.slider]
* Recall: kernel sets [.slide]*policy*, hardware provides the [.slide]*mechanism*.

[.nooutline]
== Implicit Translation

[.slider]
* _Process:_ "Machine! Store to address 0x10000!"
* _MMU:_ "Where the heck is virtual address 0x10000 supposed to map to?
Kernel...help!"
* (Exception.)
* _Kernel:_ Machine, virtual address 0x10000 maps to physical address
0x567400.
* _MMU:_ Thanks! Process: store completed!
* _Process:_ KTHXBAI.

[.nooutline]
== [.spelling_exception]#K.I.S.S.: Base and Bound#

*Simplest* virtual address mapping approach.

[.slider]
. Assign each process a *base* physical address and *bound*.
. *Check:* Virtual Address is OK if Virtual Address < bound.
. *Translate:* Physical Address = Virtual Address + base

[.nooutline]
== Base and Bounds: Cons

[.slider]
* Con: Not a good fit for our address space abstraction which encourages
discontiguous allocation. Base and bounds allocation must be mostly
contiguous otherwise we will lose
memory to _internal_ fragmentation.
* Con: also significant chance of *external* fragmentation due to large
contiguous allocations.

[.nooutline]
== [.spelling_exception]#K.I.Simplish.S.: Segmentation#

[.slider]
* Multiple bases and bounds per process, each called a
*segment*.

[.slider]
. Each *segment* has a *start* virtual address, *base* physical
address, and *bound*.
. *Check:* Virtual Address is OK if it inside some segment, or for
some segment: +
Segment Start < V.A. < Segment Start + Segment Bound.
. *Translate:* For the segment that contains this virtual address: +
 Physical Address = (V.A. - Segment Start) + Segment Base

[.nooutline]
== Segmentation: Cons

[.slider]
* Con: still requires *entire* segment be contiguous in memory!
* Con: potential for external fragmentation due to segment contiguity.

== Let's Regroup

[.slider]
.Ideally, what would we like?
* *Fast* mapping from _any_ virtual byte to _any_ physical byte.

[.slider]
* Operating system *cannot* do this. Can hardware help?

== Translation Lookaside Buffer

[.slider]
* Common systems trick: when something is too slow, throw a *cache* at
it.

== TLB Example

== What's the Catch?

[.slider]
* CAMs are *limited* in size. We cannot make them arbitrarily large.

[.slider]
.So at this point:
* *Segments* are too _large_ and lead to internal fragmentation.
* Mapping individual *bytes* would mean that the TLB would not be able
to cache many entries and performance would suffer.

[.slider]
* Is there a middle ground?

== Pages

Modern solution is to choose a translation granularity that is [.slide]*small
enough* to limit internal fragmentation but [.slide]*large* enough to allow the
TLB to cache entries covering a significant amount of memory.

[.slider]
* Also limits the size of kernel data structures associated with memory
management.

[.slide]
--
Execution *locality* also helps here: processes memory accesses are typically
highly spatially _clustered_, meaning that even a small cache can be very
effective.
--

== Page Size

[.slider]
* 4K is a very common page size. 8K or larger pages are also sometimes used.
* 4K pages and a 128-entry TLB allow caching translations for 512 KB of
memory.
* You can think of pages as *fixed size* segments, so the *bound* is the
same for each.

== Page Translation

[.slider]
* We refer to the portion of the virtual address that identifies the
page as the *virtual page number (VPN)* and the remainder as the
*offset*.
* Virtual pages map to physical pages.
* All addresses inside a single virtual page map to the *same* physical
page.

[.slider]
. *Check:* for 4K pages, split 32-bit address into *virtual page number*
(top 20 bits) and offset (bottom 12 bits). Check if a virtual page to
physical page translation exists for this page.
. *Translate:* Physical Address = Physical Page + offset.

== A Brief Interlude

== TLB Example

Assume we are using *4K* pages.

== TLB Management

[.slider]
.Where do entries in the TLB come from?
* The operating system loads them.

[.slider]
.What happens if a process tries to access an address that is *not* in the TLB?
* The TLB asks the operating system for help via a *TLB exception*. The
operating system must either load the mapping or figure out what to do
with the process. (Maybe boom.)

== Paging: Pros

[.slider]
* Maintains many of the pros of segmentation, which can be layered on
top of paging.
* Pro: can *organize* and *protect* regions of memory appropriately.
* Pro: better fit for *address spaces*. Even less internal fragmentation
than segmentation due to smaller allocation size.
* Pro: *no* external fragmentation due to fixed allocation size!

== Paging: Cons

[.slider]
* Con: requires per-page hardware translation. *Use hardware to help
us.*
* Con: requires per-page operating system state. *A lot of clever
engineering here.*

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

[.slider]
* Storing page state.
* Page table data structures.
* How to allocate more memory than we have.
* And how to make it not terrible.
