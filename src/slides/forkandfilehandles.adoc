== Today

. Finish long-winded, dull example from last time.
. Review.
. File handles.
. Process life cycle:
** *Birth:* `fork()`
** *Change:* `exec()`
** *Death:* `exit()`
** *The Afterlife:* `wait()`

== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* *Today is the add/drop deadline!*
* Recitations start this week and office hours continue.
* A preliminary website is up! It has a link to the calendar, information
about how to contact the course staff, and (most importantly): ASST0.
* We will create your class accounts later today which will allow you to use
the Discourse site and our private [.spelling_exception]#GitLab# instance.

[.nooutline]
== A Note on Grading

[.slider]
* My goal is to help everyone "make an A."
* If you are confused about anything, or have any doubts, email
`staff@ops-class.org` and we will reply promptly.

== A Note on Assignment Grading

[.slider]
* This year we have removed many of the free points from the
assignments--particularly the code reading questions.
* The goal is not to demoralize anyone. The goal is to ensure that you are
working on the parts of the assignments that are important.
* However, we *strongly* advise you to complete the recommended questions and
exercises.

[.nooutline]
== Last Time

[.slider]
.We discussed the *process* abstraction.
* Unfortunately at this point we are discussing an abstraction
(processes) built on other abstractions (threads, address spaces, files)
that we haven't discussed yet!
* There is a certain circularity to operating system design but we had
to break through at some point.
* Bear with me--we will get there and we will also keep returning to the
examples we've already introduced.
* Questions about material presented Friday?

== Process Example: Firefox

[.small]
--
.*Firefox has multiple threads. What are they doing?*
* Waiting for and processing interface events: mouse clicks, keyboard
input, etc.
* Redrawing the screen as necessary in response to user input, web page
loading, etc.
* Loading web pages--usually multiple parts _in parallel_ to speed
things up.

.*Firefox is using memory. For what?*
* Firefox.exe: the executable code of Firefox itself.
* Shared libraries for web page parsing, security, etc.
* Stacks storing local variables for running threads.
* A heap storing dynamically-allocated memory.

.*Firefox has files open. Why?*
* Configuration files.
* Fonts.

== Process Example: bash

[.slider]
* Let's do this for real using standard Linux system utilities.

== Finding bash

image::figures/finding-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* `ps aux` gives me all process, then `grep` for the one I'm after.
* ...or, do it all in one shot using `pgrep`.
* ...or, if I know it's running in my current session a bare `ps` will do.

== bash

image::figures/process-bash-3.svg[width="100%"]

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/threads-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
.What are:
* `UID`: user the process is running as.
* `PID`: process ID.
* `PPID`: parent process ID.
* `PRI`: scheduling priority.
* `SZ`: size of the core image of the process (kB).
* `WCHAN`: if the process is not running, description of what it is
waiting on.
* `RSS`: total amount of resident memory is use by the process (kB).
* `TIME`: measure of the amount of time that the process has spent
running.

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/threads-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* If `bash` had multiple threads running this view would show them, so
`bash` does not have multiple threads.

[.slider]
* I wish we could see a process with multiple threads...

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

.True confessions: I cheated here.
* `/home/challen/.bashrc` was not actually open when I ran this command.
* `bash` didn't have any interesting files open and I was embarrassed.

== Aside: the /proc/ file system

[.slider]
* How do `top`, `ps`, `pmap`, `lsof`, and other process examination utilities
gather information?
* Linux reuses the *file* abstraction for this purpose.

image::figures/procfilesystem.svg[width="100%",role='slide']

== OK... Let's Review

== OS Abstraction Cheat Sheet

[.slider]
* *Threads* save processor state.
* *Address spaces* map the addresses used by processes (virtual
addresses) to real memory addresses (physical addresses).
* *Files* map offsets into a file to blocks on disk.
* *File-like objects* look like files to a process but are not actually
stored on disk and may not completely obey file semantics.
** You can't seek on a network socket or open certain network-mounted
files.
* *Processes* organize these other operating system abstractions.

== Review: Abstractions

[.slider]
.Abstractions *simplify application design* by:
* *hiding undesirable properties*,
* *adding new capabilities*, and
* *organizing information*.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Processes

Processes [.slide]*organize information* about other abstractions and represent
a single thing that [.slide]*the computer is "doing."*

[.slider]
.Processes contain:
* one or more *threads*,
* an *address space*, and
* zero or more open *file handles*.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Processes

[.slider]
* Processes organize information about other abstractions and represent
a single thing that the computer is "doing."
* Processes contain:
** one or more *threads*,
** an *address space*, and
** zero or more open *file handles*.

[.nooutline]
== [.small]#Review: Inter-Process Communication (IPC)#

[.slider]
.IPC mechanisms include:
* files,
* return codes,
* pipes,
* shared memory,
* and signals.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Protection

One major operating system goal is to protect processes from [.slide]*each
other*.

== So Now: Questions About Processes?

== Updated Process Model

[.slider]
* For today's material being precise about how processes use files
becomes important.

* So let's update our model. Here's what we had last time:

== File Handles

[.slider]
* The *file descriptor* that processes receive from `open()` and pass to
other file system system calls is just an int, an index into the process
file table.
* That int refers to a *file handle* object maintained by the kernel.
* That file handle object contains a reference a separate *file object*
also maintained by the kernel.
* Which then is mapped by the file system to blocks on disk.
* So *three* levels of indirection:
** file descriptor -> file handle.
** file handle -> file object.
** file object -> blocks on disk.
* *Why?*

[.meme-top]
Are you just trying
[.meme-bottom]
to confuse me?

== Sharing File State

[.slider]
.The additional level of indirection allows certain pieces of state to be shared separately.
* *File descriptors* are private to each process.
* *File handles* are private to each process but shared after process
creation.
** *File handles* store the current file *offset*, or the position in
the file that the next read will come from or write will go to. File
handles can be *deliberately* shared between two processes.
* *File objects* hold other file state and can be shared *transparently*
between many processes.

== Operating System Design Principles

[.slider]
* Separate [.slide]*policy* from [.slide]*mechanism*.
* Facilitate control or sharing by adding a [.slide]*level of indirection*.

== Process Creation

Where do processes come from?

== `fork()` # create a new process

[.small.slider]
.`fork()` is the UNIX system call that creates a new process.
* `fork()` creates a new process that is a *copy* of the calling process.
* After `fork()` we refer to the caller as the *parent* and the
newly-created process as the *child*. This relationship enables certain
capabilities.

image::figures/process-updated.svg[width="60%",role='vbottom expand']

== `fork()` Semantics

[.slider]
* Generally `fork()` tries to make an *exact* copy of the calling process.
** Recent version of UNIX have relaxed this requirement and there are
now many flavors of `fork()` that copy different amounts of state and are
suitable for different purposes.
** For the purposes of this class, ignore them.
* Threads are a notable exception!

== `fork()` Against Threads

[.slider]
* Single-threaded `fork()` has reliable semantics because the *only
thread* the processes had is the one that called `fork()`.
** So nothing else is happening while we complete the system call.
* Multi-threaded `fork()` creates a host of problems that many systems
choose to ignore.
** Linux will only copy state for the thread that called `fork()`.

== Multi-Threaded `fork()`

[.slider]
.There are two major problems with multi-threaded `fork()`
. Another thread could be blocked in the middle of doing something
(uniprocessor systems), or
. another thread could be *actually* doing something (multiprocessor
systems).

[.slide]
--
This ends up being a big mess. Let's just copy the calling thread.
--

== `fork()`

[.slider]
. `fork()` copies one thread--the caller.
. `fork()` copies the address space.
. `fork()` copies the process file table.

== After `fork()`

[source,c]
----
returnCode = fork();
if (returnCode == 0) {
  # I am the child.
} else {
  # I am the parent.
}
----

[.small.slider]
* The child thread returns executing at the exact same point that its
parent called `fork()`.
** With one exception: `fork()` returns *twice*, the PID to the parent and
0 to the child.
* All contents of memory in the parent and child are identical.
* Both child and parent have the same files open at the same position.
** *But, since they are sharing file handles changes to the file
offset made by the parent/child will be reflected in the child/parent!*

== Calm Like A ``fork()``bomb

== Next Time

.*We continue* the process lifecycle:
* *change* (`exec()`),
* *death* (`exit()`), and
* *heaven* (`wait()`).
* Heaven?
* Write the code for our simple shell.
