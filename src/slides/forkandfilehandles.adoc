== Today

. File handles.
. Process life cycle:
** *Birth:* `fork()`
** *Change:* `exec()`
** *Death:* `exit()`
** *The Afterlife:* `wait()`

.At this point:
//
* If you have not started, *you are behind.*
//
* If you don't understand semaphores, *you are behind.*
//
* If you have working locks, you're a bit behind.
//
* If you have working CVs, you're OK.
//
* Keep in mind: *you need working locks and CVs for future assignments.*
//
** (The rest of the assignment is for points and won't hurt you as much in the
future.)

.True confessions: I cheated here.
* `/home/challen/.bashrc` was not actually open when I ran this command.
* `bash` didn't have any interesting files open and I was embarrassed.

Let's imagine we caught bash during startup when it is reading its
configuration parameters.

== Aside: the /proc/ file system

[.slider.small]
* How do `top`, `ps`, `pmap`, `lsof`, and other process examination utilities
gather information?
* Linux reuses the *file* abstraction for this purpose.

== OK... Let's Review

== OS Abstraction Cheat Sheet

[.slider]
* *Threads* save processor state.
* *Address spaces* map the addresses used by processes (virtual
addresses) to real memory addresses (physical addresses).
* *Files* map offsets into a file to blocks on disk.
* *File-like objects* look like files to a process but are not actually
stored on disk and may not completely obey file semantics.
** You can't seek on a network socket or open certain network-mounted
files.
* *Processes* organize these other operating system abstractions.

== Review: Abstractions

[.slider]
.Abstractions *simplify application design* by:
* *hiding undesirable properties*,
* *adding new capabilities*, and
* *organizing information*.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Processes

Processes [.slide]*organize information* about other abstractions and represent
a single thing that [.slide]*the computer is "doing."*

[.slider]
.Processes contain:
* one or more *threads*,
* an *address space*, and
* zero or more open *file handles*.

== Review: Processes

[.slider]
* Processes organize information about other abstractions and represent
a single thing that the computer is "doing."
* Processes contain:
** one or more *threads*,
** an *address space*, and
** zero or more open *file handles*.

== Review: Protection

One major operating system goal is to protect processes from [.slide]*each
other*.

[.nooutline]
== So Now: Questions About Processes?

== Updated Process Model

[.slider]
* For today's material being precise about how processes use files
becomes important.

* So let's update our model. Here's what we had last time:

== File Handles

[.slider]
* The *file descriptor* that processes receive from `open()` and pass to
other file system system calls is just an int, an index into the process
file table.
* That int refers to a *file handle* object maintained by the kernel.
* That file handle object contains a reference a separate *file object*
also maintained by the kernel.
* Which then is mapped by the file system to blocks on disk.
* So *three* levels of indirection:
** file descriptor -> file handle.
** file handle -> file object.
** file object -> blocks on disk.
* *Why?*

Are you just trying
[.meme-bottom]
to confuse me?

== Sharing File State

[.slider]
.The additional level of indirection allows certain pieces of state to be shared separately.
* *File descriptors* are private to each process.
* *File handles* are private to each process but shared after process
creation.
** *File handles* store the current file *offset*, or the position in
the file that the next read will come from or write will go to. File
handles can be *deliberately* shared between two processes.
* *File objects* hold other file state and can be shared *transparently*
between many processes.

== Operating System Design Principles

[.slider]
* Separate [.slide]*policy* from [.slide]*mechanism*.
* Facilitate control or sharing by adding a [.slide]*level of indirection*.


[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* Continue with `fork()`
* Begin talking about synchronization
